\section{Conclusion}
The project has given some insight in working with concurrent programming. 

The task has shown working with both semaphores and monitors, that monitors are simpler to use in general. Semaphores is although a little simpler for the small tasks such as tiles. The semaphore for the alley is very advanced and complicated compared to the monitor implementation. The semaphore and monitor works great for different kind of tasks, but can be used for the same in general.

The project in general have been interesting and the result is great with only some small glitches in the software. The glitches is not on the most important objectives, but would have been nice to have a semaphore for each tile. Other than the seldom collisions the software works as intended from the assignment.
